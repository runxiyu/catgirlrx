.Sh NAME
.Nm catgirl
.Nd IRC client
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Xr catgirl 1
is a terminal IRC client.
.
.Pp
Screenshot:
imagine,
if you will,
text on a screen,
next to names
in a selection of colours.
.
.Ss Notable Features
.Bl -bullet
.It
Tab complete:
most recently seen or mentioned nicks
are completed first.
Commas are inserted between multiple nicks.
.It
Prompt:
the prompt clearly shows whether input
will be interpreted as a command
or sent as a message.
.It
Split scroll:
keeps the latest messages in view while scrolling.
.It
URL detection:
recent URLs from a particular user
or matching a substring
can be opened or copied.
.It
Nick coloring:
color generation based on usernames
remains stable across nick changes.
Mentions of users in messages are colored.
.It
Topic diffing:
the modified portion
of a channel topic change
is highlighted.
.It
Ignore:
visibility of filtered messages
can be toggled.
.It
Security:
on
.Fx
and
.Ox ,
the
.Cm restrict
option enables tight sandboxing.
Sandboxing is always used on
.Ox .
.El
.
.Ss Non-features
.Bl -bullet
.It
Dynamic configuration:
all configuration happens
in a simple text file
or on the command line.
.It
Multi-network:
a terminal multiplexer such as
.Xr screen 1
or
.Xr tmux 1
(or just your regular terminal emulator tabs)
can be used to connect
.Nm
to multiple networks.
.It
Reconnection:
when the connection to the server is lost,
.Nm
exits.
She can be run in a loop
or connected to a bouncer,
such as
.Lk https://git.causal.agency/pounce "pounce" .
.It
CTCP:
apart from
.Sy ACTION ,
this protocol is useless at best
and enables abuse at worst.
.It
Protocol coverage:
IRCv3 extensions are implemented only
where they contribute to
the intended user experience.
.It
Cleartext IRC:
TLS is now ubiquitous
and certificates are easy to obtain.
.El
.
.Sh INSTALLING
.Nm
requires ncurses and
.Sy libtls ,
provided by either
.Lk https://git.causal.agency/libretls/about LibreTLS
(for OpenSSL)
